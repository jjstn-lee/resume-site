# Creating This Website
#### May 26, 2025

<div style={{ height: "25px" }}/>

## Introduction

Initially, I just wanted to create a nice and simple personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, resume, and contact information. But it also evolved into a small exercise in design; I had tons of fun showing a bit of my personality and interests through simple choices like color scheme and font type. Currently there are only 2 themes (literary and cyberpunk), but I hope to implement more very soon.

## Tools & Tech Stack

Below are all the tools and tech I used in order to build this website:

### React/Vite
Didn't see a need for anything more than this, as it wasn't a fully fleshed out web app.

### Styling
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** – for general utility-based styling.
- **[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)** – for improved theming and color variables.
- **[LightswindUI](#)** – for prebuilt animated React components (because there's no way I'm doing all that just for a menu button).
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)** & **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)** – for clean, flexible SVG icon support.

### Blog Functionality
I wanted to keep things nice and simple: just drop a `.mdx` file into the project and have it show up as a blog post on the site. Here's how I set that up:

- **[@mdx-js](https://mdxjs.com/)**: to convert markdown (.mdx) files into HTML.
- **`import.meta.glob`** – a Vite feature that lets me automatically load all `.mdx` files in the `/posts` directory without manually importing each one.
- **`useParams`** from **`react-router-dom`** – to grab the slug from the URL and dynamically select the correct `.mdx` file based on the filename.
- **Custom MDX component mapping** – used the `MDXProvider` to style core markdown elements like `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `ul`, etc., to match the rest of the site's design system.
- **Error fallback and loading state** – If no file matches the URL slug, the page shows a simple "404 – post not found" message. While the post is loading, it displays a loading message.

## Deployment

Deployment was handled through **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**, using their built-in Git integration. I connected my GitHub repository, and every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new deployment. Super easy and zero config, which is perfect for a small personal website like this one.
