# creating this website
## introduction
initially, i just wanted to create a nice and simple personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, resume, and contact information. but it also evolved into a small exercise in design; i had tons of fun showing a bit of my personality and interests through simple choices like color scheme and font type. currently there are only 2 themes (literary and cyberpunk), but i hope to implement more very soon.
## tools & tech stack
below are all the tools and tech i used in order to build this website:
### react/vite
didn't see a need for anything more than this, as it wasn't a fully fleshed out web app.
### styling
- [**tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com) – for general utility-based styling.
- [**daisyUI**](https://daisyui.com) – for improved theming and color variables.
- [**lightswindUI**](#) – for prebuilt animated React components (because there’s no way i'm doing all that just for a menu button).
- [**react-icons**](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) & [**lucide-react**](https://lucide.dev/) – for clean, flexible SVG icon support.

### blog functionality
i wanted to keep things nice and simple: just drop a `.mdx` file into the project and have it show up as a blog post on the site. here's how I set that up:
- [**@mdx-js:**](https://mdxjs.com/): to convert markdown (.mdx) files into HTML.
- **`import.meta.glob`** – a vite feature that lets me automatically load all `.mdx` files in the `/posts` directory without manually importing each one.
- **`useParams`** from **`react-router-dom`** – to grab the slug from the URL and dynamically select the correct `.mdx` file based on the filename.
- **custom MDX component mapping** – used the `MDXProvider` to style core markdown elements like `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `ul`, etc., to match the rest of the site’s design system.
- **error fallback and loading state** – If no file matches the URL slug, the page shows a simple “404 – post not found” message. while the post is loading, it displays a loading message.

## deployment
deployment was handled through [Vercel](https://vercel.com), using their built-in Git integration. i connected my GitHub repository, and every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new deployment. super easy and zero config, which is perfect for a small personal website like this one.
